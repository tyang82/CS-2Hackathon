# CS-2Hackathon

The app that we are trying to create is called Jump-Start. This application functions as an alram clock and displays an insirational quote
as the user snoozes or disables the alarm. Studies have shown that 6 out of 10 people wake up with a morning mood aka grumpy. Our team
believes that if a person wakes up in a better mood, they will have a better start to their day. This will not only allow the user to feel
happier, but also improve their mental health in the long run.

In the beginning, our group really struggled with setting up and using Git. It took some practices, trial and error, and  was not until about 
an hour later that our entire group had all the Git commands down. Git will become especially useful for us in the future when working on
large projects with multiple people all contributing code at the same time. Another big challenge for us was learning how to use android
studio to create the app. A few of our group members had a bit of experience with working with android studio. We were
able to complete a substantial portion of our project; however, there were stuggles along the way. Using android studio involved a lot of 
researching and trial and error. Learning how to use android studio and how to make a simple android application will become extrememly useful when working on adroid apps in the
future for hackathons, jobs, or individual projects.
